# The Absolutely Useless Rust Operating System

TAUROS is a very frature-limited x86-64 kernel written in Rust.
It is a personal project that helps me learn more about system programming and Rust.

## Requirements

### Compile the kernel
- Rust nightly (and cargo)
- rust-src
- gcc
- make
- grub

### Run the kernel (from the Makefile)
- qemu
- vinagre

## Features
- multiboot2 compliant
- runs in long mode
- nothing really useful...
